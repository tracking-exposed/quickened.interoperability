#### Who is working on this?

## [_librevent_ contributors](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/librevent/graphs/contributors), [_mobilizon-reshare_ contributors](https://github.com/Tech-Workers-Coalition-Italia/mobilizon-reshare/graphs/contributors), [_mobilize.berlin_ maintainers](https://mobilize.berlin/about/instance).

#### Notes

* This project has not any financial aim in its inception, we minimize data collected, and experiment a new way to contrast surveillance capitalism.
* our target audience is a group of people that want to leave Facebook and feel stuck in the monopoly effect, currently unregulated by the democratic institutions.
* it was initially developed in connection to an artistic product aimed to talk about your digital rights, the [DISAPPEAR documentary](https://www.arte.tv/en/videos/100750-000-F/disappear/).

#### Friendly reminder

# If you call Facebook "_Meta_", you are falling in their attempt of rebranding — and that's would be wrong — don't forget, don't forgive
