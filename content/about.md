#### Notes

* This project has not any financial aim in its inception, we minimize data collected, and experiment a new way to contrast surveillance capitalism.
* our target audience is a group of people that want to leave Facebook and feel stuck in the monopoly effect, currently unregulated by the democratic institutions.
* it was initially developed in connection to an artistic product aimed to talk about your digital rights, the [DISAPPEAR documentary](https://www.arte.tv/en/videos/100750-000-F/disappear/).
