## Saturday 3rd September 2022, Hackathon.

#### Regaining control of our events with [Mobilize.Berlin](http://mobilize.berlin/)

---

#### Who are we?

We are a small but dedicated group of Berlin-based hackers & Free Software advocates, artists, journalists, creators, and so on. We want to support the music, club and party scene by providing a privacy-friendly event-management platform run and managed by our own community.

One year ago we launched Mobilize Berlin, a community-driven platform to publish events based on the Free Software Mobilizon and part of the Fediverse*.

#### What is the problem?

Although many event managers support Mobilize Berlin and would love to stop using corporate data-mining services like FaceBook Events, they also want to promote their events to as many possible concert and party-goers as possible. At the moment, this means promoting their events on multiple platforms at the same time.

#### What is the hackathon about?

First of all, the hackathon is a great opportunity to get to know each other. And to become a community. **We are happy to invite you to join our Hackathon to improve two Free Software tools** for event publishers to manage their events across platforms, including [Mobilize.Berlin](http://mobilize.berlin/).

**Mobilizon-reshare** allows organizers to share events from Mobilizon on a broad selection of platforms (Facebook, Mastodon, Twitter, Telegram, Zulip), enabling automation of social media strategies and offering the possibility for people to attend an event without being forced to use a platform like Facebook (network effect). [post](https://write.as/simone-robutti/supercharge-your-events-using-mobilizon-and-mobilizon-reshare), [code](https://github.com/Tech-Workers-Coalition-Italia/mobilizon-reshare).

**[Librevents](https://libr.events)** is a browser extension to scrape (collect) events from Facebook and repost them on [Mobilize.Berlin](http://mobilize.berlin/) and other Fediverse platforms. The goal of this tool is to help [Mobilize.Berlin](http://mobilize.berlin/) reach a critical mass of events to attract users and "liberate" events from corporate data-mining services like Facebook Events, Meet-up etc. [Code](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/librevent).

#### Who is invited to attend?

Everyone, who is dedicated to further develop one of the two tools. Be it through feedback or through coding. Experience with UX Design, NodeJs, Browser Extension or Python might be useful, but is by no means necessary.

#### What can you expect?

There will be sessions presenting the work that has already been done and possible directions of further development.

You can learn more about [Mobilize.Berlin](http://mobilize.berlin/) from our [20-minute presentation at CCC in 2020](https://media.ccc.de/v/r3c-oio-241-berlin-let-s-take-back-control-of-our-events-#t=0).

We are also featured in the 2021 Arte documentary "[DISAPPEAR- cover your online tracks](https://www.arte.tv/en/videos/100750-000-F/disappear/)", which can be viewed with subtitles in 6 languages: DE, EN, FR, IT, POL, SP.
