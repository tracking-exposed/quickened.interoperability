description: We operate to expose how tracking and profiting from user data had a negative impact on society, and develop proof of concept countermeasures

### Here you'll read about the components, they are three so far:

* the [browser extension](/browser-extension), how we copy events, that are meant to be public, to make them more visible.
* [mobilizon](https://joinmobilizon.org/) the service that might replace, one day, Facebook Events. It is a federated system that allow anyone in creating their server and announce events, without a central entity that impose one global policy.
* [mobilizon-poster](/mobilizon-poster), the tool to post in mobilizon

### and [mobilize.berlin](https://mobilize.berlin) is our first use-case!

This is the launching event, a coalition of reality that wants to federate and build a critical mass to gradually sound an appealing alternative to Facebook Events.

Copying events it is a simple support for people that would have published twice, we can see this also as an _excersive_ of the _data portability_ rights

The primary audience intended for this tool and approach are people that uses Facebook Events as that's the place where _everybody is_. They would move gladly somewhere else, as is their right, and they want to bring their own data with them, as is their right. With this tool, they perform a copy of the events they publish on Facebook and also somewhere else.

Mobilizon is the first platform supported, we look forward to integrate also in [gathio](https://gath.io) and [gancio](https://gancio.cisti.org/).
