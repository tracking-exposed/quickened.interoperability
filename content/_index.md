## **Interoperability** is a characteristic of a system to work with other systems.

<div class="row" style="padding-top:5%; padding-bottom:7%">

    <pre class="primary-color" style="font-size:1.15rem">
An example: the Short Message Service <b style="font-family: monospace, monospace !important;">(SMS)</b> can be sent to <b style="font-family: monospace, monospace !important;"> everybody regardless of the provider they use or the brand of their phone</b>. It may sounds simple and taken for granted, but is not. Interoperability is a right and we let as an exercise to the reader to see how this concept can apply in the internet of today, for example when it comes to Instant messages.</pre>

### The experiment we are doing here concerns the characteristic for a post on Facebook to be visible elsewhere on the Fediverse. The primary audience intended for this tool and approach are people that uses Facebook Events as that's the place where _everybody is_. They would move gladly somewhere else, as is their right, and they want to bring their own data with them, as is their right. With this tool, they perform a copy of the events they publish on Facebook and also somewhere else.

</br>

### Mobilizon is the first platform supported, we look forward to integrate also in [gathio](https://gath.io) and [gancio](https://gancio.cisti.org/).
