#### Tweets to be send

This Saturday 11th of June, join Mobilize Berlin and @trackingexposed for a new hackathon at c-base from 14:00 to 20:00, and be part of our project called Libre Event. We want to take back control over how we socialize and get together. Let’s get free from digital platforms!

People have the right to experience their social and private life being free from invasive algorithms and greedy corporations that don’t share love for the communities they exploit. Personal data protection can be great, but we also need a safe space where to keep our events!

Improving our free-software tools we can make it easier to cross-post events on Mobilizon and other common event-management platforms. This can make life easier for those who want to organize and promote events without feeding the big tech-corps and surveillance capitalism

So take part to our hackathon at c-base this Saturday 11th of June from 14:00 to 20:00. Together we will learn how to use and improve our tool Libre Event! We will make our part for a more equal and decentralized world, imagining the future of our events and federated networks.

**Goals**

* Get people to join the hackathon
* Let our TRex audience know we are working on these kind of projects

**Plan**

* Create a rallying post for social media (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) to encourage people to share with those who are a) interested b) available c) in Berlin
* Total post = post copy + post image
* Image should be simple, largely an image with one bold CTA, the time, date and location as less attention-grabbing. The image should be visually striking and stand out in feeds
* The image should feature small logos: Trex, Mobilize
* The image should be inclusive and make a diverse group of people feel welcome to attend
* We don’t need to create an illustration from scratch - we could use creative commons / rights free existing imagery (you may also have other ideas)

#### Help to ask at the hackathon

1. how quickly can be setup a Mobilizon instance? can it be tested and documented?
2. test locally the extension and what the server is collecting - we are moving to a client side scraping
3. do a unit test of the scraper by using the bunch of HTMLs we can collect
4. test the statistics
5. test the puppeteer method
6. can the server automatically post in mobilizon? where the authentication credential should be handled?
7. can the extension pick the picture?
8. can you design a workflow for newcomers?
9. can we review all the existing texts?
