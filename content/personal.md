# STILL TODO: sorry!

This page is to show the potential abilities of:

- See which events you scraped
- Configure how frequently the events would be sent to the fediverse (it is a grace period in which you can)
- Delete events before they been uploaded to the fediverse
- Configure and review which server are configured to receive your events.
- Show you stats on the events this browser extension liberated (we don't write "you liberated" because you can simply automatize the access to facebook and forget about it)
- Review how the events have been parsed and interpreted from the weird Facebook HTML.

And if you want to edit, check out [repositories](/posts/the-softwares-and-how-to-contribute/).
